# World_Weather_Analysis
Use Python, Matplotlib, JSON and third-party APIs to collect, clean and visualize weather data

## Overview
To use google map's API to retrieve weather data from random cities across the globe and then to create various travel maps and itineraries based on specified preferences

## Results
We created dataframes listing the random cities including their latitude and longitudes as well as their current weather information (wind speed, max temps, cloudiness, humidity).

From these dataframes we then used the google maps api to create heatmaps detailing where to visit based on specific parameters (temps desired, hotel info). Unfortunately I was unable to load images of these maps as the figures were not being shown even though the code looks correct and the required dependencies were uploaded.
